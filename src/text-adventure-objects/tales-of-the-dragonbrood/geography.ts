export const GEOGRAPHY = `The lands of Dalar is made up of two continents, East and West, divided by a great inland sea called the Boiling Sea.

In the center of the boiling sea lies the Hearth, a massive active volcano that’s recuringly spewing out lava as well as great thrusts of boiling water and scorching winds. The smoke of the hearth is a clear landmark for all that live near the coast.

In the north there is a narrow and deadly water filled ravine called the Northern pass. It is surrounded by impenetrable peaks and it’s narrow shape means that when the Hearth is active it will push the hot water north at great velocity until it hits the glacial point, where it quickly turns into ice and steam, giving it the name Frost lung. The ferocious ice twirls in fantastical shapes ever higher creating a daunting glacial wall overhang. At the rare occasions when the Hearth turns inactive, the icy waters and chilling winds from the Frost lung would turn back south at great velocity, causing lethal frost and an ice tsunami to spread death across from the Northern pass and the surrounding lands.

The boiling sea also hits the southern water masses with a great force, but since the opening is greater this part of the sea is less volatile, yet the temperatures are equally deadly.

The combination of deadly heat in the boiling sea, the deadly gusts and currents in the north and south and the gigantic glacial wall means the continents inhabitants have sparse interactions with each other. Except for the southerners who are less affected when the Hearth sleeps, but that is something that hasn’t happened for a thousand years.`;
