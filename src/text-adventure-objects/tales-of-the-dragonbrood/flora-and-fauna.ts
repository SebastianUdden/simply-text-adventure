Wind-drake
* Winged predators that are active during daytime. They have white and blue shimmering scales and yellow eyes, razor sharp teeth, about 1-5m long. Moving in packs, they often prey on cattle such as lesser Earth-drakes and horses.

Shadow-drake
* Very rare winged predators who are mainly nocturnal. Black scales and yellow eyes, razor sharp teeth, they move in packs and are about 1-5m long.
