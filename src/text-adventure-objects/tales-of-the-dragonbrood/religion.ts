export const RELIGION = `In the beginning there was darkness, but then the first flame was lit, and from that fire came Dalu, the eternal. 

Dalu shook pieces of his scales that fell into that first flame, and from them the four mighty Daia was born.

First there was U’reth, the fire-breathing drake that lit the sun, then there was Gor’dan, the mighty earth-drake that brought forth mountains and cleaved the ravines with his mighty tail, after that there was Mae’thra, the water drake that could summon great floods and ocean with her strong magic, then there was Shri’t, the wind drake that flew across the earth at such speed that winds of live flew across the earth. 

However, there was another scale that didn’t land in the first flame, but was instead left in darkness. Outside of warmth, time and space. And so the four Daia lived through the first age, in a respectful battle of the elements but always in balance with Dalu.

At the end of the first age Dalu fell asleep, and this caused the blackened scale stirred. Out of it came the fifth Daia, Mal’kor, the shadow drake. He drove U’reth and the sun from the earth and plunged the world into darkness. Thus the second age was named the eternal night, and during this age descendants of the five Daia spread across all lands in a constant battle with each other. 

By the end of the second age, U’reths descendants lit the moon and the sky by setting the great Dalu mountain in eternal flame, such that it’s now only known as the Hearth. This finally drove the shadow drakes away from these lands. Gor’dans descendants retreated from the lands, instead opting to dig and dwell in great caverns. The water drake descendants of Mae’thra created the frost lands to combat the fires of the Hearth and the wind drakes offspring of Shri’t continued to spring up life wherever they could, for they knew the simple truth. That every life was precious, no matter how small, and all shall be needed to resist the coming night

and the return of Mal’kor…`;
